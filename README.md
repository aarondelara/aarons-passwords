# aarons-passwords

## Description

The motivation I had for this project was to have a stronger security for my accounts online. As a regular person with multiple accounts on different platforms of technology, I never want to come across the problem of any of my accounts being stolen and my information being stolen from me as it could lead to severe fraudulent activities. The purpose of creating this password generator was to create strong passwords and ensure that nobody other than myself will be able to access any of my accounts without my permission and to keep myself safe from hackers stealing my personal information. Luckily, I have never had any experience where I know someone was able to log into an account that I have but having this password generator would certainly guarantee that all my accounts stay safe.
